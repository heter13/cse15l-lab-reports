# **Lab Report 3 - Streamlining SSH Configuration**

This lab report will cover my ssh configuration for connecting to ieng6.

Here is the config file in my folder:

![Config File](https://i.gyazo.com/6f5e828c01285f62623b4266155a0f58.png)

For my config file, I just used notepad and titled it config, and deleted the filename at the end when it was created, leaving it with no file type.

It worked on the first try, so I did not have to specify for it to find my ssh key.

Here is my login using the new shortcut:

As you can see, the shortcut is ieng6 and it connects easier!

To show that the command works, I will use the scp command to copy a file over.

Here is the relevant screenshot:

This lab report markdown file does not exist in ieng6, so I exit and copy it over using the shortcut.

Once I log back in to ieng6, the file is there!
