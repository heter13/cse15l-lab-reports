# **SO YOU'RE TAKING CS15L**

Hello students of CS15L. It has come to my attention that you need some assistance in remote access.

Fret not, for in this tutorial, I will show you how to access your CS15L account and get started with remote coding.

## **Visual Studio Code**

One of the tools you need to get started will be Visual Studio Code. This is an IDE (Integrated development environment).
This is essentially the home base for all operations.

Go to [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download VSC for whatever operating system you are running on. If your system is not supported, let the staff know and they'll work out alternatives for you.


Your VSC should like something like this when you launch.

## **Accessing your account**

In order to connect to a remote computer, you'll need access to your course-specific account.

> Firstly, if you're on windows, you need to install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). This will allow you to connect to other computers that have the same type of account.

In order to get access to your course account, you'll need to look up your account [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).

The page should look something like this, and you can fill out either field.

Once you fill out the fields and click submit, you should be directed to a page with your associated accounts.

Click on the link that has CS15L - Quarter and Year - 3 random digits. In the above image it is the bottom one, cs15lwi22aep.

Once you have clicked on your 15L account, you should see a blue link to change your password.

![PasswordChange](https://i.gyazo.com/93a8b4746aa4f2dbd09f0421a845f1a1.png)

Click on this link, then fill out the form accordingly, keeping the same boxes checked as below.

![ChangePasswordPage](https://i.gyazo.com/def1de51846a5f30d346c809358fa231.png)

Once you have correctly filled out the form, you should be redirected to this page:

![DoneChangingPassword](https://i.gyazo.com/02949b8a147282a5f04f8b0862c42dfd.png)

Congratulations, you are now able to connect to your CS15L account using the password you set! Please give it some time to allow for the password change to take effect.

## **Connecting Remotely**

Now that your environment and account are ready to go, go into Visual Studio Code and open a terminal. This can be done by going to the top bar of the program, clicking on terminal, and clicking on new terminal. (This can also be done with the shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + ` )
